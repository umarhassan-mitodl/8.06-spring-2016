## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _8.06 Quantum Physics III_ as it was taught by Professor Aram Harrow in Spring 2016.

This course is a continuation of [_8.05 Quantum Physics II_](/courses/8-05-quantum-physics-ii-fall-2013)_._ Topics include units, time-independent approximation methods, the structure of one- and two-electron atoms, charged particles in a magnetic field and time-dependent perturbation theory. Students research and write a paper on a topic related to the content of 8.05 and 8.06.

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

- Interpret and analyze a wide range of quantum mechanical systems using both exact analytic techniques and various approximation methods.
- Gain an introduction to important model systems studied in contemporary physics, including white dwarf stars, two dimensional electron systems, the fine structure of Hydrogen, lasers, and particle scattering.
